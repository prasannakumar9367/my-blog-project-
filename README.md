# My Personal Portfolio & Blog

A fully responsive personal portfolio and blog website built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This project showcases my web development skills by dynamically loading content and providing a clean, user-friendly interface.

## About The Project

This project was created to serve as a central hub for my professional work. It's not just a static page but a dynamic web application that loads all blog post data from a JSON file, simulating how a modern front-end application would interact with an API. The design is fully responsive and aims for a clean, professional aesthetic.


## Features

* **Dynamic Content:** Blog posts are loaded from a local `posts.json` file using the JavaScript `fetch()` API.
* **Multi-Page Structure:** Includes separate, well-defined pages for Home, About Me, Contact, and individual blog posts.
* **Fully Responsive:** The layout seamlessly adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens using modern CSS Flexbox and Grid.
* **Icon Library:** Uses Font Awesome for clean, scalable social media and UI icons.


## Built With

This project was built using foundational web technologies to demonstrate core development skills.

* [**HTML5**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)
* [**CSS3**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) (including Flexbox and Grid)
* [**Vanilla JavaScript**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) (for DOM manipulation and API fetching)
* [**Font Awesome**](https://fontawesome.com/) (for icons)

 

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You just need a modern web browser.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[prasannakumar9367]/[prasannakumar -portfolio].git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd [prasannakumar_portfolio]
    ```
3.  Because this project uses the `fetch()` API to load a local JSON file, you need to run it on a local server to avoid CORS errors. The easiest way to do this is with the **Live Server** extension in Visual Studio Code.
    * Install the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
    * Right-click the `index.html` file and select "Open with Live Server".
