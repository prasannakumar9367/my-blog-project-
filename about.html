            <h2>My Journey and Projects</h2>
            <Strong>Vihari | <a href = "https://vihari-mern.vercel.app/">Project Link</a></Strong>
             <p>This project aimed to solve the common challenge of a fragmented travel market, where travelers
                struggle to find and compare services, and smaller operators lack the digital tools to reach a wider
                audience. To address this, We developed Vihari, a comprehensive travel website.
                Developed a centralized marketplace where users can seamlessly book bus tickets and holiday packages,
                while travel agents can easily add, manage, and sell their own services.
                Engineered a modern, responsive frontend using React, Redux, and Tailwind CSS, and a robust backend
                with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Redis for high performance and efficient caching.

            <Strong>Swift Bus| <a href = "https://github.com/prasannakumar9367/OnlineBusTicketBookingSystem">Project Link</a></Strong>
            <p>
                SwiftBus is a Java-based bus ticket booking system designed to let users search, book, and manage
                tickets effciently. It features a robust database built with SQL and MySQL to store and retrieve data
                like bus schedules, seat availability, and booking records. The application enhances the user experience
                by providing real-time updates on bus schedules and booking statuses, ensuring a smooth and reliable
                process.
